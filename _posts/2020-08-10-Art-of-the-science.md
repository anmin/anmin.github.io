Life goes so fast and unnoticeable in this crazy time. I can't believe it has been 25 days since my last post... During these days, my son and I had a good time making crafts and his so-called 'science experiments' (i.e. mixing contents that involves liquid and/or making a mess). They ARE fun!!

A few things that I recently developed appreciation in the household items include baking soda, vinegar, food coloring and shaving cream. [Glow-in-the-dark moon](https://www.notimeforflashcards.com/2018/06/glow-dark-puffy-paint-moon-craft.html#:~:text=Start%20by%20mixing%20the%20shaving,and%20let%20the%20kiddos%20explore.) is one example, [elephant toothpaste] (https://sciencebob.com/fantastic-foamy-fountain/) is another one. I also like to find short video clips or children's books (read out loud clip online) related to the topics, which may or may not explain the science behind the work -- it is more important that we play something that interests and fits a 5-year-old), to show the kiddo when we work on it. For example, this one on [Jimmy Kimmel Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1eG2y2mn54) for elephant's toothpaste and this [moon phase animation clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGvCuiRijI) for glow-in-the-dark moon.

Some stuff the kiddo (and I) learned was from his online camps or classes. If you are like me that enjoys arts, then this [marbled paper](https://happyhooligans.ca/marbled-paper-shaving-cream-food-colouring/) might be intersting to you. I couldn't stop making moore marbled paper for potential DIY Christimas cards.
