I never know if I can continuously talk like any bloggers online. So initially I removed the blog post of this website. 

As a tradition of where I work, every July I attend [ESRI User Conference](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/uc/overview) at San Diego. Under the circumstance we live now in this pandemic, it is not a surprise that the conference was moved online. Besides unable to meet friends, coworkers and new people in this gigantic GIS community from the world, I am actually loving it! I am able to attend more technical workshops/plenary talks and to learn out of them more than I have every been! (X-gen likes to stay at its own cocoon I guess?)

Anyway, today was the third day of the conference and I found the plenary talk (part 3) inspirational! [Vicki Phillips](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/about-us/leadership/vicki-phillips/) from [National Geographic Society](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/) talked about her vision on education for our [#GenGeo](https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2020/07/14/gengeo-introducing-our-spring-2020-national-geographic-young-explorers/). For a parent like me that is also deeply connected to geography, natural science, and education, she really inspires me to learn more about what I can do!

So here I am! I decided that I can use this blog to be my Doraemon pocket for my 5-year-old and other kids alike. Today I happily share the learning resources for the kids in classroom (online, or in person one day), at home, or anywhere else from [NGS's Education](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/) page. 

Another amazing speaker from the same plenary session today is [Jeffrey Saches](https://www.jeffsachs.org/) at Columbia University who is an economist and a huge advocate for UN [Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). This is very closely related to my training (as a soil scientist who focuses on environmental sustainability and justice) and profession (I recently started teaching spatial econometrics). But I want to keep the blog with a focus on education so I would only mention about this [resource](https://www.unitedworldschools.org/blog/un-sustainable-development-goals-our-role?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk5GLx-jP6gIVJBh9Ch12DQ1VEAAYASAAEgLJpPD_BwE) as food for thought!
