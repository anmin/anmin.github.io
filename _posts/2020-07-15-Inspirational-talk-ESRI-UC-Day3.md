title: "An inspiration talk that made my blog alive"

I can never imagine to 'talk' eloquately like many bloggers online. So initially I removed the blog post of my personal website thinking that I don't need one. 

As a tradition of where I work, every July I attend [ESRI User Conference](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/uc/overview) at San Diego. Under the pandemic circumstance we live now, it is not a surprise that the conference was moved online. Except for losing the annual opportunities to meet old friends and new interesting people in this gigantic GIS community across the world, I am actually loving the conference! I am able to attend more technical workshops/plenary talks and to get more out of them than I have every been! (X-gen is comfortable staying at its own cocoon I guess?)

Anyway, today was the third day of the UC, and the plenary talk (part 3) was inspirational! [Vicki Phillips](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/about-us/leadership/vicki-phillips/) from [National Geographic Society](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/) talked about her vision on education for our [#GenGeo](https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2020/07/14/gengeo-introducing-our-spring-2020-national-geographic-young-explorers/). As a parent of a young child that is also deeply connected to geography, natural sciences, and education, she really inspires me to think about what I can do to make a change!

So here I am! I simply decided to use this blog as my Doraemon pocket for my 5-year-old and other kids alike. Today I happily share the learning resources for the kids in classroom (online, or in person, one day), at home, or anywhere else from the [NGS's Education](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/) page. 

Another amazing speaker from the same plenary session today is [Jeffrey Saches](https://www.jeffsachs.org/), an economist and a huge advocate for UN [Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) at Columbia University . This subject is very closely related to my training (as a soil scientist who focuses on environmental sustainability and environmental justice) and profession (I have recently developed and taught a new graduate-level course in spatial econometrics). But I want to keep the blog with a focus on education thought and resource storage = so I would only mention about this [resource](https://www.unitedworldschools.org/blog/un-sustainable-development-goals-our-role?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk5GLx-jP6gIVJBh9Ch12DQ1VEAAYASAAEgLJpPD_BwE) as food for thought!
