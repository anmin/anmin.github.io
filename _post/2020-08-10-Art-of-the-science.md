Life goes on so fast during this crazy time. I cannot believe it has been 3 weeks since my last post...

Nonetheless, my son and I had a lot of fun in making crafts and his so-called 'science experiments' (i.e. mixing contents that involves liquid and/or making a mess) during these days. They ARE fun!!

A few things that I recently developed appreciation in the household items include baking soda, vinegar, food coloring and shaving cream. "Glow-in-the-dark moon"<https://www.notimeforflashcards.com/2018/06/glow-dark-puffy-paint-moon-craft.html#:~:text=Start%20by%20mixing%20the%20shaving,and%20let%20the%20kiddos%20explore.> is one example, elephant toothpaste <https://sciencebob.com/fantastic-foamy-fountain/> is another. I like to find some videos or children's books that are either related to the topic with or without explanaing the science behind it (since it has to be something interests and fits a 5-year-old) to show the kiddo when we work on it. For example, this one on Jimmy Kimmel Live <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1eG2y2mn54> for elephant's toothpaste and this moon phase animation clip <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGvCuiRijI> for glow-in-the-dark moon. 

Some stuff the kiddo (and I) learned was from his virtual camps/classes. If you are like me that enjoys making arts, then this might be intersting to you. https://happyhooligans.ca/marbled-paper-shaving-cream-food-colouring/. I couldn't stop making cards after he's done one. 

Honestly, watching or even helping him do some of these arts and science projects is so fun to me; those are on my realm.
