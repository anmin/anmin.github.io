			<h1>About An-Min</h1>
			<p>My research interests are in the integration of environmental sciences and geographic information science. Particularly, I am interested in understanding the impacts of human activities on soil and water in both natural and urban environments, their feedback on population health and the implication of environmental equity. My current research focuses mostly on soil lead contamination in the urban environment. I received my PhD in Land and Atmospheric Science with GIScience minor at University of Minnesota, a MS in Soil Science and a MEPC in Environmental Pollution Control, both from The Pennsylvania State University, and a BS in Horticultural Science (Landscape Design & Planning focus) from National Taiwan University. I enjoy meeting people; previously served as Chair for <a href="California Geographic Information Association">cgia.org</a>(2019-2020), I currently serve on the Executive Board of <a href="California GIS Council">https://cgia.org/cagiscouncil/</a>.<p>

			<p>I am FAA Part 107 certified, and I love traveling (visited 32 countries last counted), boba milk tea and wine (learned from field work in vineyards during my thesis research). Used to practice shotokan karate and spend time with friends for trips to scuba divng and rock climbing, shotokan karate, but now I skateboard and run around with my kid.
