			<h1>About An-Min</h1>
			<p>My research interests are in the integration of environmental sciences and geographic information science. Particularly, I am interested in understanding the impacts of human activities on soil and water in both natural and urban environments, their feedback to human health, and the implication of environmental justice. My current research focuses mostly on soil lead contamination in the urban environment. I received my PhD in Land and Atmospheric Science with GIScience minor at University of Minnesota, a MS in Soil Science and a MEPC in Environmental Pollution Control, both from The Pennsylvania State University, and a BS in Horticultural Science (Landscape Design & Planning focus) from National Taiwan University. Previously served as Chair for <a href="cgia.org">California Geographic Information Association</a> (2019-2020), I am currently on the Executive Board of <a href="https://cgia.org/cagiscouncil/">California GIS Council</a>.<p>

			<p>I love traveling, meeting people and learning new languages. I am FAA Part 107 certified. I drink boba milk tea and wine (as the result of field work in vineyards). When I'm not in front of computer or in the classroom, I skateboard and run around with my kid.
